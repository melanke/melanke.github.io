        I am a Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience and over 50
        successfully delivered projects. I've worked extensively with Fullstack
        Web Development and have been deeply involved with Web3 technologies for
        the past 7 years. For 12 of those years, I've also acted as a Tech Lead,
        leading teams of up to 30 professionals and gaining a strong
        understanding of digital product development.
